## Salmon Cookies

I build an adaptable app to calculate the daily sales projections of cookies for each location of the new Salmon Cookies business. The data will be presented on a nicely formatted sales page of the business's website. I will also design and construct a colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful and informative public-facing page for the website, incorporating the Salmon Cookies logo.

### How Does The Application Work

Open in a web browser.

### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab: 02

- I had difficulty setting up the object literals, most specifically when it came to methods. I came up with a solution in the end, but as I look at it, I think there is likely a much better way to do this.
- Writing the list items into the sales page was relatively easy for me. So I am simultaneously pleased and concerned....
