## Salmon Cookies

I build an adaptable app to calculate the daily sales projections of cookies for each location of the new Salmon Cookies business modified by a control curve to model heavy and lighter maximum customers based on time of day. The app will also provide projected staffing numbers per hour at each location and across all locations. The inclusion of a form and constructor function makes adding new locations simple. The data will be updated and be presented on a nicely formatted sales page of the business's website following each entry. I will also design and construct a colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful and informative public-facing page for the website, incorporating the Salmon Cookies logo as well as further images provided by the client.

### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab: 06

- I had difficulty setting up the object literals, most specifically when it came to methods. I came up with a solution in the end, but as I look at it, I think there is likely a much better way to do this.
- Writing the list items into the sales page was relatively easy for me. So I am simultaneously pleased and concerned....
- The code utilized in the app to calculate a random number of customers for each location is derived from code found at MDN Web Docs _(see link above)_

- The use of constructor functions removed a lot of the repetitive bulk in the code. However, the creation on code to render two different tables: One for sales and one for staffing reclaimed all of that real estate and more.
- I have started working on some styling and color schemes for the public facing page. I have already chosen and implemented a Google Font and styled the two tables with a sans-serif font to make them easier to read.

#### Lab: 08

- I struggled mightily with this stage, but learned the importance of making and following a plan from the start of a design project. The lessen came at the cost of hours of time and still isn't fully complete, but it will definitely influence my approach to my next project.
- The home page has been mostly organized and styled. The next step is to complete the home page and then start styling across other pages of the site.

#### Lab: 09

- I had no real troubles extending what I have learned this week in order to implement a form, an event listener and an event handler in this lab.
- I was also able to refactor the code to properly render and update the table with new locations, new totals and if different values were entered for an already existing location.
- In order to create a solution, I did some research on looping to remove every `lastElementChild` from a node at StackOverflow. _(see link above)_

#### Lab: 10

- The project went fairly well. I did not have the time to complete it to a higher quality of standard as I would have liked, but the required elements are complete and functional.
- A sales form has been created on the store page, but I am not satisfied with it and it is not complete.
- The project has been deployed on GitHub Pages.
