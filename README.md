## Salmon Cookies

I build an adaptable app to calculate the daily sales projections of cookies for each location of the new Salmon Cookies business as well as projected staffing numbers. The inclusion of a constructor function makes adding new locations simple. The data will be presented on a nicely formatted sales page of the business's website. I will also design and construct a colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful and informative public-facing page for the website, incorporating the Salmon Cookies logo.

### How Does The Application Work

### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab: 06

- I had difficulty setting up the object literals, most specifically when it came to methods. I came up with a solution in the end, but as I look at it, I think there is likely a much better way to do this.
- Writing the list items into the sales page was relatively easy for me. So I am simultaneously pleased and concerned....

#### Lab: 07

- The use of constructor functions removed a lot of the repetitive bulk in the code. However, the creation on code to render two different tables: One for sales and one for staffing reclaimed all of that real estate and more.
- I have started working on some styling and color schemes for the public facing page. I have already chosen and implemented a Google Font and styled the two tables with a sans-serif font to make them easier to read.
